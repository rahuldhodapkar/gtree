# Tests
Tests (both correctness and performance) are important to validating that the
alignment implementation developed here is *comparably accurate with* and
*significantly more performant than* the current gold-standard BWA and bowtie
aligners.

## Test Harnesses


## Correctness
Check against "truth" and against other aligners.

#### Implemented

#### Planned
- End-to-end VCF diff between aligners:
    > perfect quality
    > over different read lengths
- Paired-end alignment


## Performance

#### Implemented

#### Planned
- Differing read lengths
- Paired-end alignment
