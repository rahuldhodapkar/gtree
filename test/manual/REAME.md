# Manual Testing Situations

A set of scripts to set up some interesting situations for manual
inspection, either through a debugger, or profiler, or whatever else may
be necessary. The goal of these scripts is to build a "staged environment". 

## Technology and Dependencies

All scripts should be written for `bash`, and additional dependencies
or environment variables will be explicitly called out header notes.
